                <p>BitLearn is a product of a vision ready to make the future of education a reality. Over the past 100 years, the whole world has changed, however classrooms remained the same. We still have a system where we work like robots, and it is not longer optimal for teaching. BitLearn was supposedd to visually help anyone who wants to learn anything whether it be Computer Science, Mathematics, or even Investing. We will have games that will be in correspondence with BitPlay, another product awaiting development. BitLearn is kept on the sidelines, however, as BitSports is taking priority as our first product!</p>
