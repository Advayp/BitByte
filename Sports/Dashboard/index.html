            <h1 style="font-size:36px;">How To Play BitByte Sports</h1>
            <h6>BitByte Sports - Fantasy Sports Modernized</h6>
            <p>BitByte Sports is fantasy sports modernized! We strive to make fantasy sports easier, and more fun for everyone to join. The best part is, it can be played wherever you are! The idea of BitByte Sports came from fantasy cricket, where the developers wanted to play, only to find how challenging it is to join if you didn't have an Indian Phone Number. So we made this website, to allow all to join the fun of fantasy sports.</p>
            <h2>What are Fantasy Sports?</h2>
            <p>Fantasy Sports, specifically BitByte Sports, is a math game to obtain the most amount of points as possible. Before you click off seeing it is a MATH GAME, you should know that it is a strategy game as well. The time it takes is based upon the league.</p>
            <p>The game is based on real life, and events that happen in the real life league affect your total score in the game. The more points you have, the closer you are to achieving the trophy corresponding to the league.</p>
            <h2>How to play Fantasy Sports</h2>
            <p>When you join the draft, the draft time begins and it will distribute player cards to all the players in your group. Groups are made up of 16 players, and the person with the most points in each group gets a trophy. In Ultimate Trophy matches, groups are made up of 64 players. You will have to fill up player slots according to what you predict will happen in the games they play in. The better the player performs the more points you gain.</p>
            <h2>What Are Trophies and XP?</h2>
            <p>Trophies are given to only the few people that win a league. Trophies are extremely rare and they go up by rarity. League trophies are the least rare and many leagues have this. For bigger and more famous leagues, silver trophies are what you can win. It is much more difficult to get. Final Ultimate Trophies are given to the finals of each sport. This includes the World Cup of many sports. As such, this is the hardest trophy to recieve.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>League Trophy</li>
                <li>Silver Trophy</li>
                <li>Ultimate Trophy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you.</p>
